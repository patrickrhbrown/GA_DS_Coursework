    "# K-Means from Scratch in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we implement K-means from scratch in Python. The code draws heavily on the code in 'Machine Learning in Action' by Peter Harrington. However, it has been tuned and corrected since there were a number of errors in the code.  As the object of the exercise was to learn what is going on under the hood in K-means so that when we 'plug and chug' from modules in the future, we are able to optimise and correct lacunae, this was thought to be a permissible step in order to enrich our understanding."

    "* A while loop takes most of the strain, continuing to reposition the centroids until there is no change to the cluster assignments (in conventional kmeans deployments a max-iterations argument is available).  Instances to centroid distances are calculated with the minimum distance tracked, which is used to determine cluster assignment.  The closest centroid is recorded and the distance between the two datapoints (the product of our cost function or our error) and a check is performed to see if the cluster assignment for the instance has changed\n",
    "* at this point the centroid locations are updated by using the mean values of the member instances as centroid coordinates.  The number of iterations is also recorded\n",
    "* A check on whether convergence has been reached stops the while loop if necessary and triggers the return of the product of the algorithm when appropriate"
